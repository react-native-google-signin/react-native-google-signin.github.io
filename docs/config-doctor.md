The functionality covered in this page is available in the licensed version. [You can get a license here](https://universal-sign-in.com/#pricing) ⭐️.

A command-line tool designed to help with Android signing configuration issues and quickly resolve the infamous `DEVELOPER_ERROR`, or potentially [other errors](#when-to-use) too.

## Why[​](#why "Direct link to Why")

To save time. Developers sometimes waste hours or even days tracking down the [errors](#when-to-use).

This tool gives you the SHA-1 fingerprints that need to be added to your Google project configuration to resolve the error.

## Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage")

The tool can extract SHA-1 fingerprints directly from a device/emulator with your app installed, or from an APK file.

Run the command as shown below and follow the instructions.

```bash
# Usage with device/emulator
npx @react-native-google-signin/config-doctor --package-name com.yourapp.name

# Usage with an APK file
npx @react-native-google-signin/config-doctor --apk-path ./app-release.apk

```

### Arguments[​](#arguments "Direct link to Arguments")

* `--package-name` (optional): Your Android app's package name. If provided, the tool extracts the APK from a connected device/emulator.
* `--apk-path` (optional): Path to an APK file.

## When to use[​](#when-to-use "Direct link to When to use")

When getting `DEVELOPER_ERROR`, unexpected [`cancelled`](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/424210681) or even `GetCredentialProviderConfigurationException` during Sign-In. You can run into these errors:
