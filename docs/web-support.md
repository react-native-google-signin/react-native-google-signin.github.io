# Web support

The web implementation doesn't depend on React Native (or React Native Web). That means you can use it even with regular web apps created with NextJS, Vite and etc.

Providing a unified API across all platforms is a bit more tricky than it may seem. The web experience is different from the mobile one, and so are the underlying Google's APIs.

On the web, the `signIn` and `createAccount` functions are not `Promise`-based but callback-based as seen below. That means they return `void` and you need to provide callbacks for success and error handling. Even so, the argument and result types are the same as for native, allowing to reuse the logic for both success and error handling across all platforms.

info

The reason for callback-based apis rather than promise-based is that it's possible to get into an "error" state (when one-tap is not available) and later get a successful sign in from the button flow. Because of how the Google Sign In for web SDK is done, modeling this with a promise-based api is not possible.

## Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup")

See [here](/docs/setting-up/web.md).

## Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage")

To implement web support, follow these two steps:

1. Call `GoogleOneTapSignIn.signIn` upon page load. This attempts to present the One-tap UI. It also sets up a listener for authentication events and calls the `onSuccess` callback when the user signs in (either with the One-tap flow or the Sign-In button).

If you do not want to present the one-tap UI, pass `skipPrompt: true` in the [`OneTapSignInParams`](/docs/api.md#onetapsigninparams) object. This only sets up the listener for authentication events, and then relies on the user signing in via the `WebGoogleSigninButton`.

warning

You should display the One Tap UI on page load or other window events, instead of it being displayed by a user action (e.g. a button press). Otherwise, you may get a broken UX. Users may not see any UI after a user action, due to [globally opt-out](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/features#globally_opt_out), [cool-down](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/features#exponential_cooldown), or no Google session.

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  GoogleOneTapSignIn.configure({
    webClientId,
    iosClientId: config.iosClientId,
  });
  if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
    GoogleOneTapSignIn.signIn(
      {
        ux_mode: 'popup',
      },
      {
        onResponse: (response) => {
          if (response.type === 'success') {
            console.log(response.data);
          }
        },
        onError: (error) => {
          // handle error
        },
        momentListener: (moment) => {
          console.log('moment', moment);
        },
      },
    );
  }
}, []);

```

Optionally, you can provide a `momentListener` callback function. The callback is called when important events take place. [See reference.](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/reference/js-reference#PromptMomentNotification)

2. Render the [`WebGoogleSigninButton`](/docs/buttons/web.md) component

One-tap UI may not always be available: This happens if you disable it ([`skipPrompt`](/docs/api.md#onetapsigninparams)), when user has [opted out](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/features#globally_opt_out) or when they cancel the prompt several times in a row, entering the [cooldown period](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/features#exponential_cooldown).

`WebGoogleSigninButton` serves as a fallback. Tapping it opens the regular Google Sign-In dialog (or redirect, based on `ux_mode` param). When user signs in, the `onResponse` callback is called.

## Methods[​](#methods "Direct link to Methods")

The methods on the web are the same as on native — see [here](/docs/one-tap.md#methods) for their docs.
